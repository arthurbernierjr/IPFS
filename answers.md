## Where is data stored on IPFS?
- How is it accessed?
- A: ***Data is stored on the individual peers that are part of the network, data is accessed using content addressing as opposed to the location of the data and has a CID.***
    
## What happens when content is ‘added’ to IPFS?
- Where is the data, and what roles do peers and data structures play?
- A: ***When content is added to IPFS, it is assigned a unique cryptographic hash that acts as a fingerprint for the data. This hash is used to identify and locate the data on the network, and it ensures the integrity and security of the data. Once the data has been hashed, it is divided into smaller chunks. These chunks are then distributed across the network, where they are stored on the nodes of participating users. The data is then available to be accessed by other users on the network. Users can retrieve the data by requesting the specific hash that corresponds to the content they want to access. The network will then use this hash to locate and retrieve the data from the nodes where it is stored. The DHT data structure is what stores what peers have what data on them. The Merkle DAG is the data structure that allows for directories to point to data that belongs in them and for bigger files to point to the chunks of the same file, treating these as nodes of the graph.***

## What are some of the technical ways (such as Content Addressing) that Web3 is different from Web2, and where do you predict people will have trouble and misconceptions?

- ***Web 3 is different from Web 2 fundamentally. In Web 2 centralized authorities like Amazon, Google, Facebook etc control most of the content on the internet, to store or access any data you need to go through that centralized entity. Web 3 on the other hand is all about decentralization. Decentralized web technology lets users access data without relying on central authorities. Content addressing, which uses cryptographic hashing to give data a unique and secure identifier, makes it easy to trust data shared on the decentralized web and to rely on peers for content. Hashes act as links, not just names, freeing users from reliance on domain location. This is essential for creating a secure, trustworthy web. At the core Web 2 runs on trust in centralized entities Web 3 run on trthe trustless nature of protocols, we can verify everything.***

- An anecdote: ***I was born in 1988, and when I was a teenager, chatrooms, peer networks, and everything else were all the rage. You had to be very, very careful clicking any link, even if someone told you it was a JPG file of a cool DBZ manga chapter; you were never sure. You had to completely trust the complete stranger, and sometimes they lied to you. Centralized authorities like Google and others started to show up and started to tell people that `you can trust us`, and people gave up the freedom of the web to these people because of the fear of viruses and theft. But Web 3 brings us back to the roots of the web and fulfills the web's decentralized initial promise of freedom. That's why I love it.***
